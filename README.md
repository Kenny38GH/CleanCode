# 🤔 How to compile ?

If want to compile the project you will differents libs and tools that our project is dependent:

- OpenGL
- P6
- CMake

Then you will need to clone the git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kenny38GH/CleanCode.git
```

When it’s done, create a build folder at the root of the project

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

Then to compile use the folowing commands:

```bash
cmake ..
make
```

## 🕹️ Launch the game !

You can now launch the game with this simple command:

`../bin/CleanCode`

If you have problems to compile, you can still use an IDE which will help you with this !
